                <h2>What am I currently working on?</h2>
                <p>
                    Currently I am working at The Beamer LLC. and I just started my internship at <a href = "https://www.thehartford.com/">
                    The Hartford</a> as a Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET). I plan on making sizable contributions 
                    to the company while learning about a whole new sector of software engineering that I was originally oblivious 
                    to. Throughout the summer I will learn about test automation using Gherkin, Jenkins, and Selenium powered by 
                    Java.
                   
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a current side project, I have been working on a complete remake of my "map-app" I made for Sgt.
                    Pepperoni.
                    In the app, it will have functionality for campus and apartment navigation with re-drawn graphics to
                    be released
                    on the Google Play Store. Furthermore, I am enrolled in a game development course for RPGs (when I
                    have time to
                    dedicate towards it).
                </p>
                <h2>What am I up to?</h2>
                <p>
                    As of summer 2019, I am finishing my studies at school, with CAMS 1103 (classical mythology), and a 
                    stats course at Tunxis CC to recieve my degree. I am interning at The Hartford while still working 
                    part-time at The Beamer (which you can read more about below), and also pursuing some interests of my own.
                    Currently I am trying to purchase a new car (Mazda CX-5 Grand-Touring Reserve) and properly assess my 
                    financial obligations - most of which are taken care of. I am currently dating my "college sweetheart" 
                    who you can check out <a href = "http://www.hallardraucci.com/"> here</a>. Ironically, we have the same 
                    degree!

                    <h2>What do I do in college?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Essentially, I worked, I studied, I slept. From 2015-2019 I've been deeply involved with
                        teaching myself
                        and working. Back then, I worked for a few companies. In summer 2018 I interned for
                        <a href="https://www.iso-ne.com/">ISO New England</a> as an OPTI Engineering Intern increasing
                        efficiency throughout
                        the company. 
                        At ISO New England I created tools for automation and overhauling existing tools to
                        expand their functionality and usability. Moreover, I've been maintaining and adding to a database I
                        created at Carling Technologies. I also interned for
                        <a href="http://www.carlingtech.com/">Carling Technologies</a> developing extensive databases.   
                        Most recently I began a new database project that will completely
                        overhaul tool management, part number creation, and process documentation. Moreover, I worked for
                        <a href="http://thebeamer.com/">The Beamer LLC</a> creating AI or implementing gameplay aspects, and
                        have been from 2017 to now. During the school year I also worked for
                        <a href="http://sgt-peps.com/">Sgt. Pepperoni</a> delivering pizza to college drunks or study
                        buddies until 3AM
                        every Friday and Saturday, every weekend. Note that at any one time, I'm working at least two of
                        these jobs. My life consists of
                        the following: sleep &#8594 work/school &#8594 work/homework &#8594 eating &#8594 sleep.

                        In my senior year of college I had a senior design project where I worked for 
                        <a href = "https://www.rfsworld.com/"> RFS Meriden</a> performing predictive maintenance on their
                        manufacturing lines through machine learning. With the use of Python, Power BI, and MYSQL, we 
                        accurately predicted downtime 7/7 times for the duration of the project. You can check out the 
                        poster we had for the project here. Moreover, we won second place for Senior Design in CSE. If you 
                        would like to check out the senior design booklet, click <a href="https://www.engr.uconn.edu/large-files/pdf/UCONN-Senior-Design-2019.pdf">here</a>.

                    Well for starters, my name is Jonathan Simonin and I'm currently located in the small state of
                    Connecticut. I'm currently enrolled at the University of Connecticut studying Computer Science 
                    and Engineering (CSE), and also minoring in mathematics. My graduation date is set for Summer 
                    2019. Ever since I was a kid I was enthralled by computers, and I still am.
