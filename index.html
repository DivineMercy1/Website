                <h2>What am I currently working on?</h2>
                <p>
                    A bunch of things. Recently I've been working on gameplay development, enhancement, and AI programming for my internship 
                    at The Beamer - you can check out my video recordings of development in progress
                    <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bxu9uuAwtNIjbDg0V2ZFYmwyR1k">here</a>. 
                    At ISO New England I created tools for automation and overhauling existing tools to
                    expand their functionality and usability. Moreover, I've been maintaining and adding to a database I
                    created at Carling Technologies. Most recently I began a new database project that will completely overhaul 
                    tool management, part number creation, and process documentation. 
                    When I'm not working, I like to teach myself whatever I can - not just
                    programming or computer science topics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a current side project, I have been working on a complete remake of my "map-app" I made for Sgt. Pepperoni. 
                    In the app, it will have functionality for campus and apartment navigation with re-drawn graphics to be released 
                    on the Google Play Store. Furthermore, I am enrolled in a game development course for RPGs (when I have time to 
                    dedicate towards it).
                </p>
                <h2>What do I do?</h2>
                <p>
                    Essentially, I work, I study, I sleep. For the past 4 years or so I've been deeply involved with teaching myself 
                    and working. Currently, I'm working for a few companies. This summer I interned for
                    <a href="https://www.iso-ne.com/">ISO New England</a> as an OPTI Engineering Intern increasing efficiency throughout 
                    the company. I also intern for
                    <a href = "http://www.carlingtech.com/">Carling Technologies</a> developing extensive databases, and for
                    <a href="http://thebeamer.com/">The Beamer LLC</a> creating AI or implementing gameplay aspects, and have been for 
                    the past two years or so. During the school year I also work for
                    <a href="http://sgt-peps.com/">Sgt. Pepperoni</a> delivering pizza to college drunks or study buddies until 3AM 
                    every Friday and Saturday, every weekend. Note that at any one time, I'm working at least two of these jobs. My life consists of
                    the following: sleep &#8594 work/school &#8594 work/homework &#8594 eating &#8594 sleep.

                    Well for starters, my name is Jonathan Simonin and I'm currently located in the small state of Connecticut. I'm currently
                    enrolled at the University of Connecticut studying Computer Science and Engineering (CSE), and also minoring
                    in mathematics. Ever since I was a kid I was enthralled by computers, and I still am.
