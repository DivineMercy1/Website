                <h2>What kind of work interests you?</h2>
                <p>
                    I like doing any kind of work that allows me to learn something. From front end to back end development, it's all fun to
                    me. I've done database development, gameplay programming, AI programming, web development, user interface
                    programming, and more - it never gets dull and I am always learning from it; therefore, any kind of work
                    that tests my skills and patience interests me.
                </p>
                <h2>What was your upbringing like?</h2>
                <p>
                    Since I was 3 years old I played video games. I remember getting a transparent purple GameBoy Color when it came out, playing
                    Super Mario, Pokemon, and other games on it. After a while I started thinking about what went into a
                    video game: how it was made, how it was designed, the audio work that was involved, the story-telling
                    components, the gameplay that made it unique, etc. etc. These thoughts always confused me and I never
                    understood it all until I decided to teach myself programming and learn Unity 3D in high school where
                    I took on the challenge of creating a video game for my Capstone Project. Making a game is beyond difficult,
                    and doing it alone is a never ending mission essentially. Video games were my passion, still are, and
                    is what keeps me intrigued as I see so many advancements in the industry every year.
                </p>
                <h2>Do you have any hobbies, besides gaming?</h2>
                <p>
                    Well, yes. Although I have sunk many hours into gaming, even competitively, I do have many other hobbies. Here's a few:

                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Got any miscellaneous things you want to share?</h2>
                <p>I sure do.</p>

                        I have green eyes, even if you can't see it in the picture to the right.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I've known my most of my best friends since I was in center school and I think that's pretty neat.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I enjoy thriller movies like Prisoners, action movies like Mission Impossible, and anything with Jake Gyllenhaal or Tom Cruise
                        in it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I love chocolates, chocolate ice cream, chocolate milk, and anything chocolate for the most part.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        My favorite RPG would probably be Oblivion, action/shooter would be Rainbow Six: Vegas 2, and...well I could go on for a
                        long time about games so I'll just stop there.
                    </li>

                        My dream car is to have a Corvette, and one day it will be a reality.
