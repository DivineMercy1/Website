                <h2>All about CSE 1010:</h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout CSE 1010, although I had some prior programming experience in high school, we had a
                    rudementary crash course into programming thinking.
                    At the start of the course, we got introduced to the langauge "Matlab", which was an unfamiliar
                    language to me. Matlab is quite popular amongst
                    engineers, so it made sense that every engineer would take a course using it. Although the course
                    description does not include this, we mainly
                    dealt with arrays and matrix functions and how we could perform functions to create some sort of
                    algorithm.
                </p>
                <h2>All about CSE 1102:</h2>
                <p>
                    Following 1010, we were required to take CSE 1102 which is a Java-oriented course. During the
                    semester we learned about the paradigms of OOP,
                    as a few are listed in the course description. Most of this course taught how we could program an
                    event to occur based on conditions; so we
                    could see a cause and effect with code. Moreover, as we learned the paradigms of OOP, we used the
                    drawing libraries of Java to help show this
                    to us. Lastly, throughout this course, we learned about errors and debugging programs; something I
                    would later learn is a nightmare when solving
                    complicated issues in tougher languages like 'C' in CSE 3100. Lastly, we covered unified modeling
                    language (UML) for design of programs and
                    how to properly build a blueprint for programs.
